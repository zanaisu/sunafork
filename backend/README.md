# Suna Backend

## Running the backend

Within the backend directory, run the following command to stop and start the backend:

```bash
docker compose down && docker compose up --build
```

## Running Individual Services

You can run individual services from the docker-compose file. This is particularly useful during development:

### Running only Redis and RabbitMQ

```bash
docker compose up redis rabbitmq
```

### Running only the API and Worker

```bash
docker compose up api worker
```

## Development Setup

For local development, you might only need to run Redis and RabbitMQ, while working on the API locally. This is useful when:

- You're making changes to the API code and want to test them directly
- You want to avoid rebuilding the API container on every change
- You're running the API service directly on your machine

To run just Redis and RabbitMQ for development:```bash
docker compose up redis rabbitmq

Then you can run your API service locally with the following commands

```sh
# On one terminal
cd backend
poetry run python3.11 api.py

# On another terminal
cd frontend
poetry run python3.11 -m dramatiq run_agent_background
```

### Environment Configuration

When running services individually, make sure to:

1. Check your `.env` file and adjust any necessary environment variables
2. Ensure Redis connection settings match your local setup (default: `localhost:6379`)
3. Ensure RabbitMQ connection settings match your local setup (default: `localhost:5672`)
4. Update any service-specific environment variables if needed

### Important: Redis Host Configuration

When running the API locally with Redis in Docker, you need to set the correct Redis host in your `.env` file:

- For Docker-to-Docker communication (when running both services in Docker): use `REDIS_HOST=redis`
- For local-to-Docker communication (when running API locally): use `REDIS_HOST=localhost`

### Important: RabbitMQ Host Configuration

When running the API locally with Redis in Docker, you need to set the correct RabbitMQ host in your `.env` file:

- For Docker-to-Docker communication (when running both services in Docker): use `RABBITMQ_HOST=rabbitmq`
- For local-to-Docker communication (when running API locally): use `RABBITMQ_HOST=localhost`

Example `.env` configuration for local development:

```sh
REDIS_HOST=localhost (instead of 'redis')
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=

RABBITMQ_HOST=localhost (instead of 'rabbitmq')
RABBITMQ_PORT=5672
```
